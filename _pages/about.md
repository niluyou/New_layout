I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto under the supervision of [Professor John W. Simpson-Porco](https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~jwsimpson/). Before this, I earned my Master’s degree at Queen’s University (2023) in the [ePOWER](https://www.queensu.ca/epower/) group and completed my undergraduate studies at Isfahan University of Technology (2021), majoring in control systems. My expertise lies in the intersection of Control Systems, Power Systems, and Power Electronics.
